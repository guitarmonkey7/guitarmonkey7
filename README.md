- 👋 Hi, I’m @guitarmonkey7
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and anything related to computers. I also play piano and guitar and love to write and record music on the side. I've been programming/coding for about 3 years and I am pretty...ok at Python, SQL and C#/.NET.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development at MGa University and I am concurrently learning (that means "all at the same time") PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning projects, useful web apps, and anything that will challenge me but is still grounded in reality - the reality that I'm a novice overall and at best intermediate in a few areas.
- 📫 How to reach me: Through Github or on LinkedIn, at https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahcliett/
